# Egocentric Value maps
This contains the scripts necessary to reproduce the simulations and analyses for the Egocentric Value maps manuscript

*NOTE: this repository is still in the process of being cleaned up*

## System Requirements
All plots and analyses were performed on Matlab 2022b, but any version of Matlab from 2022a onward should do.

The analyses require only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations.

## Installation
Just unzip the EgocentricValueMaps folder wherever you find appropriate and run
```
addpath(genpath('chosen_filepath\EgocentricValueMaps'));
```

## Usage Examples

### Run analyses for figures and stats
The scripts necessary to create each figure and the corresponding stats are in the 'Figures' and 'Stats' folders. $$$ NO MORE STATS --> all in figures $$$

### Generate data
To generate the simulated data for both ANN and tabular simulations, run CreateDataForPlots.m

*! ----------------WARNING:-----------------!*

This will take VERY long to run. It is recommended to either run sub-sections of this file independently, or better yet just load the the files from the online Matlab Workspaces (also shown below), while running the scripts in the 'Figures' folder.
